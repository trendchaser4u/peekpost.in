                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        2018 I quit my job at Pearson. I made the decision to move on after being 3+ years
                        a software engineer at different startups and MNC. It was a tough decision to make, because the
                        company
                        had a huge impact on me from a personal and professional perspective. It is always hard to move
                        on. But then again, I didn’t want to get too comfortable. And I don’t want to get stuck in one
                        particular lifestyle either. I want to experience different things like i always to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step natural step for me was being self-employed. Over the last year, I’ve put a lot
                        of effort into my website and I started freelancing, consulting and teaching people about
                        software engineering, web
                        development, JavaScript, tools such as Webpack, Firebase, Redux, React, Node, Vuejs. It was a
                        tough time to balance personal life, professional life and
                        (professional) side-projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I want to be bold and try to make this next step to have more time for the things that I
                        truly value. I would separate my services into four cornerstones: Consulting, Freelancing,
                        Teaching and
                        Developing. Find more about these cornerstones in the article in order to know about what i
                        do.

                    <h3>Developing Apps</h3>
                    <p>
                        The First cornerstone of my endeavour is making new stuff. While I worked in my last 9 to
                        6 job, I collected a huge list of ideas over time. I guess most of the people are keeping such
                        a list, but there is never enough time to tackle all of these items. Recently, it was the first
                        time that I showed my ideas to someone else. I was astonished that I had gathered over 1000
                        items in various lists and sublists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All these items are ideas about applications, things I want to learn, things I would like to
                        teach and things I want to write about. But as full-time employee, I never found the time to do
                        all these things. Maybe I even don’t find the time right now, where I have to figure out how to
                        earn my own share, but that’s what this adventure is all about.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Teaching</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second cornerstone of my endeavour is teaching. Writing about my own learnings in web
                        development started as a sheer experiment. I enjoyed the process of writing, digging into the
                        problems by trying to explain them to myself, and bringing the solutions on paper in concrete
                        yet simple words. I never expected others to read about them. Many people supported me in my
                        doings and they gave me the
                        opportunity to teach; an activity that I discovered as a meaningful thing to do in my life.

                    <h3>Consulting and Freelancing</h3>
                    <p>
                        All this jabbering about being self-employed, making and teaching doesn’t work without
                        generating any income whatsoever. That’s why my final cornerstone is consulting and
                        freelancing. After working for years with like minded colleagues in the 9 to 6 world, I always
                        wanted to give consulting a shot in my life. Now I thought it would be the perfect time. I
                        would love to work closely with clients on applications and solving their problems. In this
                        scenario, I am able to shift from being a consultant, who is giving advice and a clear strategy
                        for the application, to being a freelancer who can deep dive into the code and solve problems
                        for you.

                        So, if you are seeking for a on-site/remote tamil/english speaking software engineer, don’t

                    <p>
                        It is an exciting time for me right now. At the moment, I am working with companies in Chennai
                        remotely migrating their tech stack to web technologies. So if your company is keen to work
                        with me on such things, or mentioned opportunities from the list, reach out to <a href="./contact"

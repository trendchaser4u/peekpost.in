                        Allo, I am a indian software engineer from Chennai but working remotely most of the time. First
                        of
                        all, thank you for visiting me here. It’s such a pleasure to have you here!.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A couple of words about my academic and professional life: I graduated from university with a
                        Bachelor of Technology in IT in 2014. At university I discovered how empowering it can be to
                        build web applications and thus built several applications in different programming languages,
                        domains and platforms. Straight out of university, I worked in a full-time position as software
                        engineer on a large scale web application using JavaScript and Php to help thousands of
                        part-timers to find out exciting part-time jobs. Those years gave me a lot of
                        practical experiences in the software field. At 2018, I decided to be
                        self-employed, doing freelance and consultant work mostly related to web development. But I am
                        always keen to learn something new, so I try to push myself every day. One of my recent
                        learnings, by doing courses, reading books, listening to audio material and applying those
                        learnings in JavaScript, is mobil apps development. I am open for any opportunities in this
                        field or software engineering.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-info animate-box">
                    <h3>My Values and Mission</h3>
                    <p>
                        I always try my best to have a positive impact on the world and believe web can do more than
                        that
                        now its doing . <strong>99.99%</strong> of my code is open source for
                        everyone on <a href="https://github.com/trendchaser4u" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Every time I
                        build a product/service for
                        myself, I immediately think about
                        how to open source it for others. Even though I open source my work and offer lots of learning
                        material for free, not everyone is able to make use of it. Many people have no access to it
                        because they didn’t had the chance to learn the English language in the first place. I have the
                        strong believe
                        that the major issue of diversity in our industry is due to inaccessible education for people
                        outside of the western world. Apart from the language barrier, most educational content is too
                        expensive. Whereas a programming course for $99 might be affordable in the US, it’s out of
                        reach for any eager programmer in South East Asia. I know that many programmers producing
                        educational courses need to make a living, I am sitting in one boat with them, but there are
                        options to make educational content affordable for others around the world too. After all, I
                        hope that I can give something back by believing in these values and my mission to make
                        education more accessible to everyone.

                    <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        Even though I do a lot of programming in my professional and spare time, there are other things
                        I treasure too. I am an avid reader, but I’m always struggling to memorize my learnings. I
                        guess, that’s why I started to write down my notes of books I enjoyed to read. But it’s
                        difficult to keep up with all the books. Nowadays I often encourage people to read more,
                        because it’s such a fulfilling and meaningful activity. After I love cameras, super cars ....
